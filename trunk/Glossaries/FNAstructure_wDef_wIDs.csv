Terms that denote the interconnection of equivalent structures are predicated on a single collective subject and suffice in themselves to describe the condition; e.g., 'sepals connate.'  However, those that denote the connection of dissimilar structures require explicit notation of each type of structure involved, in either a compound-subject construction or else a single-subject/object-of-preposition construction; e.g., 'stamens and corolla adnate' or 'stamens adnate to corolla.'  Qualifying detail is sometimes appropriate; e.g., 'filaments connate basally,' 'filaments adnate to the petals over their lower halves.'","90e554e6-59be-4eb2-8d3d-0d358972b54a"

"gametophyte","The main, ultimate, gamete-bearing stage in the haploid (n chromosomes) phase of a taxon's life cycle.  Two morphologically and genetically distinct and alternate stages together constitute the complete life cycle in sexually reproducing taxa, the other phase (sporophytic) being diploid (2n chromosomes).  Any taxon whose life cycle is confined to one or the other phase is limited to asexual means of reproduction, since sexual reproduction and consequent genetic recombination are impossible without alternation between haploid and diploid states via meiosis and fertilization.  The term gametophytic applies to any part of the haploid phase, including all unicellular to multicellular entities belonging to it, whereas gametophyte is reserved for the principal and directly gamete-producing stage of that phase.  In all vascular plant taxa the sporophyte is the dominant and most conspicuous phase of the life cycle.  The gametophytes of 'lower' vascular plants (ferns and 'fern-allies') are physically independent of the sporophytes and, though inconspicuous, merit description in their own rights.  Those of gymnosperms and angiosperms are minute and physically dependent upon (contained within) sporophytic structures and are not usually included in morphological descriptions.  In the flowering plants at least, the haploid phase is (presumably evolutionarily) reduced to such a degree that the existence of gametophytes per se is debatable.","3e8c8c90-2ada-4e94-b4d1-79df39321a8f"

"lobed","Having one or more component sectors or peripheral protrusions that is/are delimited by concavities in the surface or margin and that is/are not proximally distinct from the remainder of the whole.  The meanings of this term and its approximate synonyms sometimes have been supposed to differ according to the depth of the delimiting concavities relative to the midline or midpoint of the overall structure, and/or to the shape or proportions of the protusions or sectors; however, there has been little consistency in the applications of the various terms according to such distinctions, which are ones only of degree and are necessarily arbitrary in any case.  In general usage, these terms differ only indistinctly and connotatively: cleft, lobed (or lobate), parted (or partite) and segmented tend to connote fewer protrusions or sectors; lobate usually connotes as well a generally rounded shape; dissected tends to connote more numerous sectors that are elongate and angular.

"margin","Configuration of all or part of the periphery of a planate structure, sometimes referred to as though it were discrete and an entity in its own right for descriptive purposes.  The extent of the area considered to pertain to the margin in a given case is, of necessity, subjectively determined.  As a general rule, peripheral concavities that do not exceed 1/5 the distance from the generalized edge to the center or main axis of the structure are considered components of marginal configuration, deeper concavities being considered components of overall shape.  The margin is sometimes considered to be only the infinitely thin boundary itself, and such a definition is probably the one most technically correct from the standpoint of geometry and general usage.  However, it is inconsistent with traditional usage in descriptive botany, which treats the margin as an entity of substance both semantically and conceptually.  The semantic antecedent of some descriptors is 'margin,' whereas the antecedent of others is the structure as a whole (e.g., leaf).","d39ff35b-0923-4115-803d-e6c73e2fabfb"

"pubescence","Collective aspect of trichomes borne on the surface.  Many of the terms traditionally used for describing pubescence have been defined and used in so many differing and often contradictory ways that they have become hopelessly ambiguous.  This is attributable mainly to overdefinition within this portion of the traditional lexicon - that is, to highly arbitrary and widely variant restriction of a term's scope to some one detailed combination of trichome character states (shape, size, orientation, etc.).  By derivation these are essentially general terms, really suited only for denoting overall aspect.  The diversity actually encountered in nature defies comprehensive and unambiguous resolution into any limited suite of precisely specified, mutually exclusive, complex character states that can be associated with these terms, which are best used only in their general senses.  Sometimes, such description will be sufficient in itself; more often, additionally or alternatively, the various attributes of the individual trichomes should be described.  This is the only strategy that allows for full description of any possible condition, including the presence of more than one type of trichome.  The various terms used for describing pubescence have never been semantically consistent; in some cases they refer to the trichomes themselves, while in others they apply to the bearing surface or structure; e.g., sericeous (the trichomes themselves are collectively silky) versus barbate (the structure is bearded).  See also coating, indumentum (vesture).","bd1e584f-76b0-4cb3-8ac2-8f38fb85ec5b"
